# Retrospective Ideas

Retrospectives are a great way to check in on the health of your team, but it's easy to get stuck in a rut when running retrospectives.
For a long time I used a simple "what went well?", "what didn't go well, "what could we improve?" format for all retrospectives.

As much as I like simplicity, these retrospectives get boring quickly and start having less impact over time. Adding different formats or ideas is a great way to get more out of your team retrospectives.

Most retrospectives follow the same structured format:

#### 1.) Set the stage
Make sure everyone knows what the purpose of the retrospective is, how long it will run for and what the format will be.
Try and make people feel at ease, ensuring everyone has whatever tools they need to participate (access to Trello, sticky notes, pens etc).

#### 2.) Gather data / brainstorm
Everyong provides inputs to the retrospective

#### 3.) Generate Insights
This is where you discuss items with the team.

#### 4.) Decide on actions
Decide what concrete actions you will take based on the retrospective. How will you address the issues raised?

#### 5.) Generate Insights
Closing: donâ€™t just walk away but close the retro with an activity

## Retrospective Ideas

Here is a list of other retrospective formats that you can use to tailor to a specific situation.
I currently use Trello for online retrospectives but any other tool will work including a whiteboard and sticky notes.

## Simple (Good, Bad, Improve)

The goals of this retro is to quickly identify positives, negatives and areas for improvements within the team.

- What went well?
- What didn't go well?
- What could we improve?
